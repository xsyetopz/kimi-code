/**
 * Deprecated `kimi server` shim.
 *
 * The `kimi server` command tree was replaced by `kimi web` (a foreground
 * server opened in the browser). Any `kimi server …` invocation — bare or
 * with any legacy subcommand/flags — lands here, prints the deprecation
 * notice, and exits 1. The shim itself is scheduled for removal in the next
 * major version of Kimi Code.
 *
 * One subcommand stays functional: `kimi server kill`, the cleanup path for
 * background servers started by pre-0.28.0 builds (recorded in the legacy
 * single-instance lock, which the instance registry never sees).
