/**
 * Shared video delivery ladder.
 *
 * A local video becomes a model-visible content part through one channel:
 * upload it via the provider's video upload channel (the tiny `ms://<id>`
 * reference), and only fall back to an inline base64 `data:` part when the
 * channel is missing or the upload fails for a non-auth reason. Two failures
 * are the exception and must surface instead of being masked behind an inline
 * payload: auth rejections (401/403), which drive credential refresh and a
 * clear auth error, and a cancelled delivery signal — the caller is tearing
 * the turn down, so the interruption propagates as the signal's abort reason
 * rather than silently delivering a degraded part.
 *
 * Both ReadMediaFile (videos the model reads itself) and the turn-level
 * prompt-media resolver (videos attached directly to a prompt) share this
 * ladder so their delivery and fallback semantics stay identical.
