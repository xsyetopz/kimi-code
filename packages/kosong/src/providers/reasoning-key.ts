 * - `reasoning_details` — OpenRouter.
 * - `reasoning` — OpenAI's GPT-OSS guidance; current vLLM renamed to this
 *   (vllm-project/vllm#27752) and its request side accepts ONLY this name
 *   (vllm-project/vllm#38488).
 *
 * Inbound we accept any of them via a priority scan; outbound we echo back the
 * dialect the peer actually spoke, learned per endpoint by ReasoningKeyDialect.
