/**
 * TranscriptInteraction — a session-global interaction entity (approval /
 * question).
 *
 * Interactions are entity-only: there is no inline step frame for them. An
 * interaction anchored to a tool call (`toolCallId` present) renders inline
 * at the linked tool frame (`ToolCallFrame.approvalId` ↔ `toolCallId`), and
 * the owning step is derived transitively through that frame (never
 * denormalized onto the entity). An interaction without an anchor is
 * unanchored and renders floating (e.g. at the end of the transcript).
 *
 * Interactions are still NOT step content: they are resolved asynchronously by
 * user action, possibly long after the originating step flushed, so they live
 * beside `tasks` — global per agent transcript, never paginated. When the
 * anchor frame pages out of the loaded window the entity remains in the
 * global set; it just has no inline position within that window.
 *
 * Plan-mode review is deliberately not special: `ExitPlanMode` flows through
 * the ordinary approval path and the plan card renders from the linked tool
 * frame's `display` payload.
